# MMM-TouchNavigation

This an extension for the [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://magicmirror.builders/).
This Module adds a touch menu to send different notifications to the other modules.

It is very simmilair to [MMM-TouchNavigation](https://github.com/tosti007/MMM-TouchNavigation), however with this module you can choose the notification and it does not offer the "fade-out" of the buttons feature.

## Installation

In your terminal, go to your MagicMirror's Module folder:
````
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
````

Clone this repository:
````
git clone https://github.com/tosti007/MMM-TouchNotifications.git
````

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
````javascript
modules: [
    {
        module: 'MMM-TouchNotifications',
        config: {
            // See 'Configuration options' for more information.
        }
    }
]
````

## Configuration options

The following properties can be configured:

| Option             | Description
| ------------------ | -----------
| `showBorder`       | Determines if the border around the buttons should be shown. <br><br> **Possible values:** `true` or `false` <br> **Default value:** `true`
| `minWidth`         | The minimum width for all the buttons. <br><br> **Possible values:** `css length` <br> **Default value:** `0px`
| `minHeight`        | The minimum height for all the buttons. <br><br> **Possible values:** `css length` <br> **Default value:** `0px`
| `picturePlacement` | The location of the symbol or image relative to the text. <br><br> **Possible values:** `left`, `right`, `top` or `bottom` <br> **Default value:** `left`

## Configuring Buttons
Buttons have to be placed in `buttons` in the `config`. A button contains a configuration in an object (`{}`).

| Option         | Description
| -------------- | -----------
| `text`         | A string to display in the button. <br><br> **Note:** if no value is set no text will be displayed. <br> **Possible values:** `string`
| `symbol`       | A symbol to display in the button. <br><br> **Note:** if no value is set no symbol will be displayed. <br> **Possible values:** See [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) website
| `size`         | The size of the symbol. <br><br> **Note:** will only have effect on the symbol. <br> **Default value:** `1` <br> **Possible values:** `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` or `5`
| `img`          | An image to display in the button. <br><br> **Note:** it will only display if no symbol is set. <br> **Possible values:** A path to an image (an url or local path)
| `width`        | The width of the image. <br><br> **Note:** will only have effect on the image. <br> **Possible values:** `number`
| `height`       | The height of the image. <br><br> **Note:** will only have effect on the image. <br> **Possible values:** `number`
| `notification` | The notification that should be send when pressed. <br><br> **Note:** required, see [Configuring Notifications](#configuring-notifications) <br> **Possible values:** object (`{}`) or array (`[]`) of objects

An example:
````javascript
buttons: [{
  // this is a button with only a single notification
  text: "Example 1",
  symbol: "ban",
  notification: {
    type: "SHOW_ALERT",
    payload: {
      type: "notification",
      title: "Example 1",
      message: "Hello World!"
    }
  }
}, {
  // this is a button with multiple notifications
  text: "Example 2",
  notification: [{
    // the first notification
    type: "SHOW_ALERT",
    payload: {
      type: "notification",
      title: "Example 2",
      message: "Hello"
    }
  }, {
    // the second notification
    type: "SHOW_ALERT",
    payload: {
      type: "notification",
      title: "Example 2",
      message: "World!"
    }
  }]
}]
````


## Configuring Notifications
An notification configuration is fairly simple and only contains a little bit of information which is both required. This will be the actual notification that will be send when the button is pressed. It totally depends on the other module what payload should be here.

| Option    | Description
| --------- | -----------
| `type`    | The kind of notification to send when pressed. <br><br> **Note:** required <br> **Possible values:** `string`
| `payload` | The payload to send with the notification. <br><br> **Note:** it depends on the module you want to address with `type` what you want to use here.


## Notes
* **Important:** unfortunatly positioning this module as fullscreen will result in the menu floating top left. I currently do not know how to fix this but will look into it. If you know how don't hesitate to either write me or send me a pull request!
* If the image is an local path and it does not show. Try different ways to write the local path. If this still does not work then try putting the image in a folder in your MagicMirror folder and use as local path `foldername/imagename`.
* If only heigh or width is set for an image the other size will scale to maintain it the image it's original aspect ratio.
* If both the `text` and `symbol` aren't set for a button then the button won't contain anything, but still show the border.
* The symbols are all form the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) website.
* The text may contain HTML tags and will be displayed as HTML.
